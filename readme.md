# Playfair algorithm

it's a simple realization of a Playfair cipher for Russian alphabet <br>

u can choose file to encrypt/decrypt after running a program

in test.txt u can see encrypted poem of A. S. Pushkin, u can decrypt it using key word "Пушкин" 

no punctuation included, because for Playfair algorithm it's quite useless
